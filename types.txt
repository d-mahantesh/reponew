Numbers has several types to reppppresent the numbers. Generally we split numbers into different kinds: Integers and Floating-point numbers

Integers:
Integers - like their mathabcematical counterpart - are numbers without a decimal component,(...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2...) Unlike the base-10 decimal system
we use to represent numbers, computers use base-2 binary system

Go Integer Types: uint8, uint16, uint32, u122int64, int8, int16, int32, int64. 8,16,32,64 tell us how many bits, uint is unsigned integer and int is signed integer
